              The KYC process requires banks to collect and assess updated identity-related documentation
              (credentials) from all their clients based on a largely manual, repetitive, inefficient, time-consuming,
              cumbersome, non-standardised, and expensive process that lacks in security. Banks alone spend over $500m
              on KYC annually.

              Umazi is built on distributed ledger technology, allowing participants to agree on a shared source of
              truth and perception using execution of smart contracts over secure, immutable data. The value and
              security of a network built on DLT grows exponentially with the number of participants. Existing systems
              can also be integrated easily and solutions can be tailored to meet specific user and client requirements.

              Umazi represents a utility to all participants but is built from the client's perspective and provides
              enterprise level integration into financial institutions and corporate entities as well as legal and data
              verification services. Clients are able to control and manage their own data, platform and client
              relationships, whilst allowing financial institutions to manage risk assessment and compliance.

            <p class="feature-text text-primary p-4">
              Umazi is built on an open data model which provides interoperability and scalability of data being
              shared on a distributed ledger. By building on a network that is owned by participants and not by a single
              trusted party, participants are able to build their own solutions and integrations utilising the same
              underlying data, therefore incentivising participants to utilise the Umazi utility.

              The Umazi network leverages an event driven model where state transitions on the distributed ledger raise
              events which can trigger processes within integrated systems to provide automation over digital claims and

              The Umazi network provides the ability for identity information to be established and attested so that

              The claims provides a secure, digital solution to sharing attestable facts to establish existence and
