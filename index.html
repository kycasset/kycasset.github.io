              Corporate clients are required to present identity-related documentation (credentials) to financial
              institutions, law firms, real-estate brokers and insurance companies. This is largely a manual,
              repetitive, inefficient, time-consuming, cumbersome, non-standardised and expensive process that exposes
              both institutions and their clients to security risks.
